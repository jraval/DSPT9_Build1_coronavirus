# DSPT9_Build1_coronavirus

This is my first project.  I used the New York Times repository on coronavirus and forked a branch to my own repositories.
Here is the main branch that I forked from:
https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

This is the article the Times created:
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html

I attribute my data to :

“The New York Times and Dynata” 

or

“Estimates from The New York Times, based on roughly 250,000 interviews conducted by Dynata from July 2 to July 14.”
